# File-Names
#program that prompts the user to enter two file names (both files include integer numbers), then merge the numbers in two files and write all the numbers into a third file.

# The program takes  Input from two different files and writes its output to a third file.   Each input file contains a list of numbers of type int in sorted order from the smallest to the largest. After executing (Run), the output file will contain all the numbers in the two input files in one longer list in sorted order from smallest to largest. 

# The program should define a function that is called with the two input-file streams and the output-file stream as three arguments.   Students should test the program on the provided example files (input1.txt and input2.txt), however, your program should let the user enter the file names.
